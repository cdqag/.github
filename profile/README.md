## Data Quality Solutions & Services

### Companies want data they can rely on, but data changes quickly

How can they keep up with the heavy burden of master data maintenance? With constantly cleaned and enriched data, we help you create trusted customer and vendor master data that paves the way to seamless data-driven processes, better business decisions, and to maximize the potential of data for true innovation. CDQ brings master data automation to the data economy. Our vision for your business partner data: zero maintenance, 100% quality.

CDQ enables large enterprises to tackle data quality and data maintenance efforts collaboratively. This results in high master data quality with low manual efforts for our customers. We achieve this by validating against 2,500+ data quality rules, continuously updating existing records, and enriching missing information. Pulling from more than 70 external reference data sources such as open data, commercial registers, third-party services, and shared data from the community, our data quality solutions provide the best master data quality.

CDQ (which stands for Corporate Data Quality) emerged from the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland, and has more than 17 years of data management expertise, spending years on researching how to create and maintain trusted customer and vendor master data. Many well-known global companies from different industries already rely on our CDQ Suite, which offers Data Quality as a Service (DQaaS) and collaborative data management to reduce their data maintenance costs significantly.

Data sharing, as 'the next big thing’, is a giant opportunity for all of us and we want to be the leading light. We must grow fast and strong to use this window of opportunity. Additionally, we want to grow our knowledge and expertise as well as our own personalities - we are open to suggestions and feedback by others.

### AMBITION

We set ourselves ambitious goals to make data sharing happen and try to overachieve our targets together as a team. We challenge the status quo, we seek continuous improvement to deliver the best possible services to our internal and external clients and we co-innovate with our community.

### FOCUS

We are focused in order to achieve growth, high customer satisfaction, innovation and a unique product. In this fast-paced environment we prioritize on what will give us and our customers greatest impact. We work as one team focused on the same goals.
